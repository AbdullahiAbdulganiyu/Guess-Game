# Guess-Game
created while practicing with jonas schmedtman
There is a hidden number that is randomly generated and the goal is to be able to guess that number correctly
If the guess is higher than the randomly generated number you get a message that says Too higher
But when the guess is lower you get a message that says Too low
Once the guess is exact you get the message, You won
Once you guess the random number correctly,  the random number is diplayed for you to see.
Anytime you guess wrongly you get 1 deducted from your current score.
Your current score would be the highest you've scored throughout the game
To start again and reset all the previous entry you can click on the Again button.
The again button resets the game so that you can start guesssing again. 
Clicking the again button also make you loose your current and even highest recorded score.
