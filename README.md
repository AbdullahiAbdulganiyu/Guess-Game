# Guess-Game
created while practicing with jonas schmedtman
There is a hidden number that is randomly generated and the goal is to be able to guess that number correctly
If the guess is higher than the randomly generated number you get a message that says Too higher
But when the guess is lower you get a message that says Too low
Once the guess is exact you get the message, You won
Once you guess the random number correctly,  the random number is diplayed for you to see.
Anytime you guess wrongly you get 1 deducted from your current score.
